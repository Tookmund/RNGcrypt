N.B. this should not be used on any important data! It is intended as a joke! <br />
<br />
RNGcrypt is a state of the art encryption algorithm that is completely impossible to break! <br />
<br />
Features/Bugs: <br />

* Consistantly generates 1 KiB of data no matter how large the input is!
* Easy to implement in any programming language!
* Completely unbreakable (as long as you have a good random number generator)
* No need to decrypt data!
